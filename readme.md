# Deploying Node or Java App using Elastic Beanstalk LAB

## Overview

Deploy a basic Node.js or Java application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk. This lab demonstrates the complete deployment workflowâ€”from code versioning in GitHub and packaging the application as a source bundle to deploying via Elastic Beanstalk using an S3 URL. Optionally, you may build an automated CI/CD pipeline that packages and uploads your code to S3.

## Tasks:

- Commit application code to a GitHub repository
- Ensure the repository contains all necessary files (e.g. package.json for Node.js or the appropriate build files for Java)
- Application must also be zipped and uploaded to S3 Bucket (can be done manually or automatically via pipeline)
- URL of S3 bucket must be supplied to Elastic Beanstalk

## Note:

- Deploy Node or Java App based on your primary specialization
- Use of database with application is not required
- Build a pipeline that zips application code and uploads to S3 bucket (optional, but will warrant additional marks if successfully executed)
